# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
A sentiment analysis project using NLP techniques, TF-IDF vectorization, machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and deep learning (LSTM) to classify text reviews as positive or negative with performance evaluation and visualizations.
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and both machine learning and deep learning models. The workflow includes:
Data Preparation & Cleaning: Combining multiple datasets, handling missing values, stopword removal, and text preprocessing.
Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization for text representation.
Model Training & Evaluation: Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were trained and compared using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
Deep Learning Approach: An LSTM-based neural network was implemented to capture sequential dependencies in text, achieving strong performance on sentiment classification.
Visualization: WordClouds for positive and negative reviews, confusion matrix heatmaps, and model comparison charts.
The project demonstrates a complete pipeline for sentiment analysis and can be extended to other text classification tasks, providing insights into customer feedback and user opinions.
